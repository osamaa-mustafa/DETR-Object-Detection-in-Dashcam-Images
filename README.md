# DETR-Object-Detection-in-Dashcam-Images
DETR (DEtection TRansformer) is a transformer on top of a convolutional backbone. 
We used this DETR, the backbone ResNet-50 that is used for feature extraction is pre-trained on COCO by Meta AI. 
We pre-trained it on our custom dataset
The link to run the notebook directly is provided in the "Readme Details" file. It also contains google drive link to the pre-trained weights file that we trained for 20 epochs on our custom dataset.
